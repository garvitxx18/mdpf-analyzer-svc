# Server Start Issue - Solution

## The Issue

`npm run dev` appears to hang or crash silently. This is likely due to:

1. **Swagger compatibility issue** with NestJS v10
2. **Database connection timeout** 
3. **Missing .env configuration**

## Quick Fix

### Option 1: Run Without Swagger (Fastest)

Temporarily remove Swagger to get the server running:

```bash
# Comment out Swagger imports in src/index.ts temporarily
# Then run:
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Fix Database Connection

The server is trying to connect to Supabase on startup. Either:

1. **Create tables in Supabase** (run the SQL in Supabase dashboard)
2. **Disable eager database connection**

### Option 3: Use Production Build

```bash
npm run build
PORT=3000 node dist/index.js
```

This won't auto-reload but will show errors more clearly.

## Immediate Action

Check what happens when you run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Look for any errors in the terminal output. The most common issues are:

1. Database connection errors
2. Missing API keys in `.env`
3. Swagger decorator compatibility

## Next Steps

Once the server starts, you should see:
```
Application is running on: http://localhost:3000
Swagger documentation: http://localhost:3000/api
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000/api` to see the Swagger UI.
