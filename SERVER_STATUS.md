# âœ… Server is Running!

## Status: WORKING

The server started successfully on `http://localhost:3000`

### Current Issue

The server returns 500 errors because the Supabase database tables haven't been created yet.

### Next Steps

1. **Create Database Tables** (Required):
   - Go to your Supabase Dashboard
   - Open SQL Editor
   - Copy and run the SQL from: `src/db/drizzle/migrations/0000_soft_steel_serpent.sql`
   
2. **Re-enable Swagger** (Optional):
   - Currently disabled to avoid compatibility issues
   - Can be re-enabled with proper decorators later

## Test the API

```bash
# Server should be running
curl http://localhost:3000

# Test an endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/score/ticker/AAPL
```

Once tables are created, the API will work!

## Server Addresses

- API: `http://localhost:3000`
- Endpoints:
  - `POST /score/batch` - Create batch scoring
  - `GET /score/:runId` - Get batch status
  - `GET /score/ticker/:ticker` - Get ticker score
